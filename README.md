# RTC_GreenInfrastructure
SWMM input files and Python files from a comparative simulation analysis of phosphorus removal of a real-time controlled bioretention cell to an uncontrolled bioretention cell (underdrain always open) with and without soil amendments under several influent concentrations and storm conditions.
